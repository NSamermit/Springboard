Using a grid-search method for ARIMA models, the supervised machine learning model found optimized parameters based on these specifications:
Start AR term: 1
End AR term: 3
Start MA term: 1
End MA term: 3
Start Differencing Term: 1
Test Parameter: Augmented Dickey Fuller
Seasonality: False
Auto_Arima() grid search yielded these models for these counties:
Berkshire: ARIMA(3,1,0)
Essex: ARIMA(0,1,0)
Hampshire: ARIMA(0,1,1)
Middlesex: ARIMA(1,1,0)
Nantucket: ARIMA(2,1,0)
Suffolk: ARIMA(1,1,0)


The model metric used was the Mean Average Precision Error: 0.70935
This is not an accurate model, but as discussed with my mentor, when forecasting trends sometimes the accuracy isnâ€™t the focus but rather the trend.
